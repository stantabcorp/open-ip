# open-ip

This project is **Work In Progress**!  
*We are trying to find supporters who will let us use their internet connection, to harvest data for theses databases.*

You will be able to know:
  - [x] The country of the ip address
  - [x] The ISP, with all sort of information
  - [x] The usage type of the ip address (Datacenter, Proxies, Customers...)
  - [x] More to come
